## Type in "play()" to start the game! ##

This was the first game I programmed without a step-by-step guide. I mostly used my COMP 110 knowledge (especially from the Wordle exercise).

Things to improve: 
- Ask the user if they want to play again instead of telling them to type in "play()" on the end screen ðŸ˜…
- Readability! - break up the code into more descriptive functions
